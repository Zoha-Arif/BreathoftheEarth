        thief tactics to the test and steal \
         a pair of shoes from the King of the Blues. On a dazed night, you hide under a blanket of bushes outside the Blue Kingdom until \

     the Blues unnoticed. However, the vines and thickets grow strong and thick and gaunt \

     You can hear the wood of other crates stack next to you and on top of you. Then, someone pulls all the crates away.\
