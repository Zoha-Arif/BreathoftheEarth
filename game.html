You are an outlandish strange thief named Nino living on an Earth in a universe parallel to ours. 
A thousand years ago, as the mountains, prairies, and deserts of this Earth were in the process of being sculpted 
by the heavenly hands of a divine force, a foreign choice was made. The divine force of this Earth, the creator, 
suppressed the three purely pigmented primary colors of the Universe -- yellow, red and blue -- into a celestial 
silver orb. Each of these orbs were put into a sculpted location on the basin of a river named the Interstellar River.
 Their visible light flows from their respective silver orbs into the Interstellar River and color is emitted into the
  Earth from the basin of this river. If any of these silver orbs are removed from the basin of the river or are 
  demolished, the respective color of that silver orb and any child color of the respective color of that silver 
  orb will cease to exist.

        <br/><br/>
        When the souls were breathed into the creatures of this New Earth, the creatures felt that to best protect the visible colors, three different nations were to be created. 
        Each nation would have the obligation to protect one respective silver orb. 
        <br/><br/>
        As an outlandish thief, you were in exile from birth and never pledged allegiance under god to any Nation. You often find your being in the outlands, scouring the Red Desert 
        for mussels and the uninhibited stretches of the Interstellar River for yellow fish. 
        At the age of 14, however, one day, you find that your shoes collapse from years of running and tarnishing. 
        Instead of staggering stealthily into the nearby Nation of the Yellows and stealing a pair of shoes, you decide to put your clever thief tactics to the test and steal
         a pair of shoes from the King of the Blues. On a dazed night, you hide under a blanket of bushes outside the Blue Kingdom until the dusty streets are silent. 
         There are two ways to enter the Blue Kingdom: you can climb the wall or look around for a crack in the thick kingdom walls for you to climb through.
