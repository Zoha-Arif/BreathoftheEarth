    or breach in the wall that smugglers and other thieves use to enter to Nation of \
    the Blues unnoticed. However, the vines and thickets grow strong and thick and gaunt \
       thorny branches are strewn across the wall, making it that more difficult, in the pitch darkness,\

     -- the cash crop of the Blue Kingdom -- are stacked into pyramids all around you. \
     Dust rises around you from your fall and when you finally adjust to the scenery, \
     you hear heavy footsteps, the whispers of metal, and the faintest of breath, assumably, \
     a Kingdom guard, approaching your location. You have two options: you can hide inside a \
     crate or confront the guard.",

     As you lay silently, you hear the sound of the foot steps approach your crate. \
     Suddenly, you feel that the crate you are in is lifted briefly and placed down roughly  upon another platform. \
     You can hear the wood of other crates stack next to you and on top of you. Then, someone pulls all the crates away.\
      The crates placed besides you close up all tunnels that air, making the environment suffocating and difficult to \
      breathe in and the weight of the crates above you cause the lid of your crate to sink in and weaken.\
      You can lie quietly and hope that a chance to escape the crates comes soon or you can yell for help."
